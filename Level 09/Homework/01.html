<p>According to FIFA, modern soccer began in England in 1863.
     However, the very earliest form of kicking a ball seems to have originated from a Chinese military manual dating back to the 2nd and 3rd centuries called Tsu' Chu.
     A senior football match consists of two 45-minute halves and must have a 15-minute break in the middle.
     A team can start with a maximum of 11 players, of which one is the designated goalkeeper.
    Me and my friends are playing  5v5 street football. The rules are almost same but there are only 5 people in one team.
